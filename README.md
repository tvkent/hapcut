# hapcut

Use hapcut reads from *grandiflora* aligned to *rubella* to see if long stretches of blocks contain reference geno

### Data
* vcfs and bam files needed to run hapcut on standout individuals -- get from wei
* other indivs to parse and plot are on capsicum in /data/ in wei's folder youngwha

### To Do:
* parse out the number of SNPs and the length of each block, and the total ref and non-ref alleles for each
* plot SNPs, length, and SNPs/length by the min sum of 1's in hap block
